    <h1>My Day At a Glance</h1>
    <h2>Morning</h2>
    <p class="morning-tasks">
      Get up. Feed the dogs and cat, put on a pot of coffee to get myself roaring for the day. Meditate while the coffee brews and get back upstairs to start studying Launch School before work, then hop in the shower before heading out the door.
    </p>
    <h2 class="afternoon">Afternoon</h2>
    <p class="afternoon-tasks">
      Eat lunch. Continue finishing up any work that needs to be done for my full-time job and try to sneak a peak at some Launch School topics if there is downtime. Then I head home and shovel out some of the ridiculous amounts of snoe we've gotten this winter in the Northwest, and settle back down to the computer for some more studying.
